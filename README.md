This repository contains multiple Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) projects performed on real-world datasets.
The goal is to practice data cleaning, visualization, statistical analysis, and insight generation using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
These projects demonstrate foundational data science skills required for analytics and machine learning roles.
